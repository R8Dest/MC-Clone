Ancient Warfare -> Immersive Engineering -> Buildcraft -> Industrial Craft -> Mechanism -> Big Reactors
								-> Minechem -> Genetics
								-> AE2
						->Thermal Expansion Powergen
Laser, Atomic Dissassembler
Jetpack, Glider
Jetpack Fuel needs to be waaaay more difficult
special invasion resistant block
intigrate mystcraft into tech tree?

use extreme crafting table

how do i setup so one needs the next... 
make it so creasote creation (furnace) needs ancient warfare?
remove buildcraft engines? 
any buildcraft engine also needs something that requires an immersive engineering machine
such as the crusher or blast furnace. refinery? 
make plates for buildcraft machines through metal press
industrial craft needs dusts that can only be made by a pulverizer? 
pulverizer becomes super special block (needs extreme crafting?)


special plates needed to make machines, specially buildcraft,



New Materials:
chromium, tungstanite, radium carbide, Paladium, Nanitium, Aerograde Steel
